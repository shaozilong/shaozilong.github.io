CMake gets started with vcpkg

Install vcpkg
Installing vcpkg is a two-step process: first, clone the repo, then run the bootstrapping script to produce the vcpkg binary. The repo can be cloned anywhere, and will include the vcpkg binary after bootstrapping as well as any libraries that are installed from the command line. It is recommended to clone vcpkg as a submodule for CMake projects, but to install it globally for MSBuild projects. If installing globally, we recommend a short install path like: C:\src\vcpkg or C:\dev\vcpkg, since otherwise you may run into path issues for some port build systems.

Step 1: Clone the vcpkg repo

git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git

Make sure you are in the directory you want the tool installed to before doing this.

Step 2: Run the bootstrap script to build vcpkg

.\vcpkg\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat

Install libraries for your project for x64 windows
vcpkg install [packages to install]:x64-windows

Using vcpkg with MSBuild / Visual Studio (may require elevation)
vcpkg integrate install

After this, you can create a new project or open an existing one in the IDE. All installed libraries should already be discoverable by IntelliSense and usable in code without additional configuration.

Using vcpkg with CMake
In order to use vcpkg with CMake outside of an IDE, you can use the toolchain file:
cmake -B [build directory] -S . -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[path to vcpkg]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[install directory] -G"Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64

Then build with:

cmake --build [build directory --config Release

Finaly, install the output lib, dll and include headers 

cmake --build [build directory

Exemple for RL master branche :

cmake -B ../build/RL_master -S rl_master -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/src/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_MANIFEST_MODE=ON -DVCPKG_MANIFEST_DIR=../../manifest -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../build/LIB_RL_master -DBUILD_DEMOS=ON -DBUILD_EXTRAS=OFF -DBUILD_TESTS=OFF -G"Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64

cmake --build ../build/RL_master --config Release

cmake --install ../build/RL_master
